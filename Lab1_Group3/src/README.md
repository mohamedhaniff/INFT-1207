Lab 1: Password Generator
Authors: Mohamed Haniff and Joel Gabud

Description: A README file going over the assignment asking a user for a numbered amount of values and how many of those values there are to make a strong password.

The code shown in the attached file effectively uses validation and integers in order to make the program work properly.
Not only following the minumum of 8 characters for the password, but also using a maximum of 20 to help make it more secure.
Try and except values are also needed in order to validate the input that the user submits so that it does not get out of hand.
The 'random' function is more than necessary here to actually get the program done, as the password itself needs to be randomly generated as per the instructions.
Everything was thought of, including ensuring that upper and lowercase letters were included via integers and further definition of things to help specify things.
